# Private Notes

This section contains personal methodologies, confidential information, and private documentation that should remain local-only.

## Example Content

- Personal workflows and methodologies
- Confidential client information
- Private research and analysis
- Personal project notes

## Getting Started

1. Create subfolders for different areas (e.g., `research/`, `personal-projects/`)
2. Add `.qmd` files for documents you want to export
3. Add `.md` files for web-only content
4. Use the build script to generate exports: `./build.sh`

## Sample Structure

```
