# Keeping Your System Updated

Your documentation system gets regular improvements, new features, and bug fixes. Here's how to stay up-to-date easily.

## 🔔 Automatic Update Notifications

Your system automatically checks for updates when you start it. You'll see a notification like this:

```
📢 Documentation System Update Available!
   Run './update.sh' to get the latest features and improvements
   Your content will be safely preserved during the update
```

## 🚀 One-Command Update

When you see an update notification, just run:

```bash
./update.sh
```

That's it! The script handles everything automatically.

## 🛡️ What Gets Updated (and What Doesn't)

### ✅ Gets Updated
- **Hugo theme** - New features, design improvements
- **Build scripts** - Performance improvements, bug fixes  
- **Sample content** - New tutorials and examples

### 🔒 Stays Safe (Your Content)
- **All your documents** in the `content/` folder

- **Any customizations you've made**

## 📋 Update Process Details

### What Happens During Update

1. **Safety First**: Complete backup of your content
2. **Download Latest**: Gets newest version from GitHub
3. **Smart Merge**: Updates system files, preserves your content
4. **Version Tracking**: Sets up automatic update checking
5. **Testing**: Verifies everything works correctly

### Time Required

- **First-time setup**: 2-3 minutes (includes Git setup)

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Rollback Command
If you have any issues after an update:

```bash
./update.sh rollback
```

This restores your system to the previous state.

### Manual Recovery
Your content is always backed up in the `backups/` folder:

```
backups/
├── content-backup-20250121-143022/
├── content-backup-20250115-091500/
└── .latest-backup
```

You can manually restore from any backup if needed.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Check for Updates Manually
```bash
./check-updates.sh
```

### Update Without Prompts (Advanced)
```bash
echo "y" | ./update.sh
```

### View Update History
```bash
# See what changed in recent updates
git log --oneline -10
```
