## ‚úÖ Setup Checklist

- [ ] Obsidian installed and vault created

- [ ] Can see your content folder structure
- [ ] Created a test document
- [ ] Can preview changes in Hugo site
- [ ] Understand basic Markdown formatting

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Can't see files?** Make sure you opened the `content` folder as your vault, not the root documentation folder.
