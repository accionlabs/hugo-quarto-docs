# Welcome to Your Documentation System

This is a powerful documentation system that combines Hugo's static site generation with Quarto's document processing capabilities.

## Getting Started

1. **Replace this sample content** with your own documentation
2. **Organize your content** in the three main sections:
   - **Private**: Personal notes and confidential information
   - **Projects**: Client work and project deliverables  
   - **Shared**: Team knowledge and methodologies

## Features

- 📊 **Quarto Integration**: Write in Markdown/Quarto format with export to DOCX/PPTX
- 🔍 **Smart Navigation**: Hierarchical sidebar with expand/collapse
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
- 🖨️ **Print-Friendly**: Clean printing with content-only view
- 🚀 **Fast Performance**: Static site generation with Hugo
- 📝 **Rich Content**: Support for diagrams, math, code, and more

## Structure

```
content/
├── private/     # Personal and confidential content
├── projects/    # Client work and project deliverables
└── shared/      # Team knowledge and shared methodologies
```

## Next Steps

1. Delete or move this `content-sample/` folder
2. Create your own `content/` folder structure
3. Start adding your documentation
4. Run `hugo serve` to see your site locally

Happy documenting! 📚
